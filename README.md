## Project Structure

- `app/Http/Controllers` - Contains the controllers handling the CRUD logic.
- `resources/views` - Contains Blade templates for the UI.
- `routes/web.php` - Defines the application routes, including CRUD routes.

## Usage

- **Creating a Record**: Navigate to `/create` and fill out the form.
- **Reading Records**: View all records on the homepage or individual records by their ID.
- **Updating a Record**: Edit records by navigating to `/edit/{id}`.
- **Deleting a Record**: Delete records using the delete button on each record.

### Routes Example

This project uses `Route::resource` for simplified routing. Here is the primary resource route:

```php
Route::resource('items', ItemController::class);
